answer the question on my public blog - whats up?

This is a social media type application developed using the popular web framework Django. Users can create posts about anything they would like, but the predominant theme is to answer the question - what's up? The features of this site include a registration portal, login/logout system, a profile system, the ability to update posts, and pagination. The website is hosted using Heroku and uses PostgreSQL for database purposes (and AWS S3 for file storage).
